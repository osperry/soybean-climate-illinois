## The problem this study has to solve first

Illinois soybean yield rose from **33.5 bu/acre in 1980 to 62.5 in 2025**. Almost all of that is technology, roughly 0.65 bu/acre per year from cultivar improvement and agronomy.

That trend is an order of magnitude larger than any climate signal in the sample. Because temperature also trended over the same period, a model that leaves the trend in will credit warming with the genetics and **return a positive temperature coefficient**, predicting that a hotter Illinois yields more.

This pipeline removes the trend county by county, because county trends themselves span 0.290 to 0.846 bu/acre per year. Everything downstream targets the residual.

```
yield_anom = yield_bu_ac - (a_county + b_county * year)
```

## Four findings

### 1. Heat is nearly harmless when there is water

The temperature effect is **conditional on moisture, not additive with it**. Mean yield anomaly in bu/acre against county trend:

|          | Wet       | Dry       |
| -------- | --------- | --------- |
| **Cool** | **+1.44** | −1.17     |
| **Hot**  | **+1.45** | **−5.26** |

Hot-and-wet performs identically to cool-and-wet. Together, heat and drought cost roughly double what their separate effects predict.

The regression agrees. The marginal effect of temperature is:

| Moisture condition        | dYield / dTemperature |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Dry (10th pct, 4.3 in)    | **−0.887** bu/acre/°F |
| At sample means (7.7 in)  | −0.664                |
| Wet (90th pct, 11.4 in)   | **−0.429**            |

An additive model understates warming risk systematically.

### 2. Detrending doubles the signal

| Predictor                   | r vs detrended | r vs raw yield |
| --------------------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| **Palmer Z-index, Jul-Aug** | **0.490**      | 0.311          |
| Jul-Aug precipitation       | 0.464          | 0.296          |
| August max temperature      | −0.469         | −0.286         |
| Palmer PDSI, August         | 0.349          | 0.243          |

Climate has no trend and yield does, so the trend acts as pure noise in the raw correlation.

The **Palmer Z-index outperforms both raw precipitation and PDSI**. It is the current-month moisture departure accounting for antecedent soil water. PDSI carries too much memory from months that no longer affect the crop.

### 3. Timing beats magnitude

June rainfall is worth nothing. August rainfall is worth everything.

| Month, precipitation | r with anomaly |
| -------------------- | -------------- |
| April                | −0.134         |
| May                  | −0.091         |
| June                 | 0.076          |
| July                 | 0.317          |
| **August**           | **0.342**      |
| September            | −0.020         |

The critical window is July and August, growth stages R3 through R6, pod set and seed fill. April is mildly negative because wet springs delay planting. September is noise; the crop is already made.

Aggregating over the full April-September season weakens the relationship to **0.177**. Choosing the wrong window destroys the signal.

The response is also nonlinear, with an interior optimum near **12.5 inches** over July-August and a decline beyond it. The drought penalty is roughly three times the wet-year bonus.

### 4. Vulnerability concentrates where the buffer is thinnest

County sensitivity to August moisture varies **more than sevenfold**, from 0.47 bu/acre per standard deviation in Mercer County to 3.60 in Clay County. The pattern tracks soil water-holding capacity rather than rainfall.

Two cross-sectional relationships sharpen the point:

- Structurally hotter counties respond more steeply to moisture, `r = +0.606`
- **Higher-yielding counties are less climate-exposed**, `r = −0.512`

Advantage compounds. The best ground both yields more and varies less. A single pooled climate coefficient averages a county where August moisture explains 48% of the variance with one where it explains 3%.

## Simulated warming and drying

**These are sensitivity experiments, not climate projections.** They apply uniform shifts to observed climate, use no CMIP6 or IPCC pattern, carry no probability information, and assume no agronomic adaptation, cultivar change, or planting-date shift.

| Scenario                | Δ bu/acre | Δ %    | Counties down |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ------ | ------------- |
| +1 °C                   | −0.31     | −0.68  | 89 / 91       |
| −10% precipitation      | −0.27     | −0.59  | 88 / 91       |
| **+1 °C and −10%**      | **−0.73** | −1.62  | **91 / 91**   |
| +2 °C                   | −0.64     | −1.42  | 91 / 91       |
| +2 °C and −20%          | **−2.03** | −4.48  | 91 / 91       |

The combination exceeds the sum of its parts, which is finding 1 expressing itself again.

![Simulated yield change under +1C and -10% precipitation](figures/fig17_scenario_map.png)

Losses concentrate in the southwest, where baseline yields are already the lowest in the state. The few counties showing small positive responses sit in the cool northeast, below the estimated temperature optimum.

## Does climate actually predict?

Validation is strictly temporal. **No random splits anywhere.** They fail twice over here: they admit future information, and because counties within a year share weather, they place near-duplicates of test rows into training.

- **Fixed split**: train 1980-2013, validate 2014-2018, test 2019-2025
- **Expanding window**: rolling origin, one test year at a time, 2001-2025, 2,317 test observations

The comparison that matters is not algorithm versus algorithm. It is a **trend-only baseline against models that see climate**.

| Model                    | RMSE      | MAE   | R²        | Skill vs baseline |
| ------------------------ | --------- | ----- | --------- | ----------------- |
| **Gradient Boosting**    | **4.844** | 3.680 | **0.284** | **+15.7%**        |
| HistGBM                  | 4.870     | 3.706 | 0.276     | +15.3%            |
| Random Forest            | 4.895     | 3.723 | 0.269     | +14.8%            |
| Linear Regression        | 5.090     | 3.892 | 0.209     | +11.5%            |
| Ridge                    | 5.095     | 3.896 | 0.208     | +11.4%            |
| Baseline: trend only     | 5.748     | 4.424 | −0.008    | 0.0               |

Climate wins by **15.7%**, which establishes that it carries real predictive content.

But gradient boosting beats ridge regression by only **4.9%**. Most of the available signal is linear once the quadratic and the interaction are specified. That is the honest headline, stated before a reviewer asks.

## What this study cannot answer

### 2003 defeats the climate model

Decomposing predictions by year: 1988 is explained to **88%**, 2012 to **41%**, and 2003 to only **15%**.

Statewide August PDSI in 2003 was slightly positive and rainfall near normal, yet yield fell 8.5 bu/acre below trend. Northwest Illinois lost 18.3 bu/acre. The East district lost 15.1 **with a positive moisture index**. 2003 contributed 14 of the 39 observations exceeding three standard deviations in the entire panel.

A non-climatic driver is indicated. Insect pressure is the standard candidate for that year in the upper Midwest and the northern concentration fits, but **this analysis did not test it** and it should be checked against extension records before anyone asserts it.

### Other limitations

- **Monthly resolution cannot resolve frost or daily extremes.** The coldest monthly mean minimum in the record is 32.3 °F. No degree-days above a threshold, no dry-spell length, no rainfall intensity, no vapour pressure deficit. This is the largest methodological gap. gridMET 4 km daily is the upgrade path.
- **County coverage collapses after 2018**, from 102 counties reporting to 62, and survival is not random. The recent panel skews toward large producers exactly where out-of-sample validation happens.
- **Planting date is missing**, and 2019 shows why. It is the one year where adding climate makes predictions *worse*, because the rain arrived in spring and delayed planting in a way seasonal aggregates cannot see.
- **No causal identification.** Fixed effects absorb time-invariant county traits and statewide annual shocks, not county-specific time-varying confounders such as drainage, cultivar turnover, pest pressure, or land-use change.

The correct statement of the result is therefore: higher July-August temperatures and lower July-August moisture were **statistically associated** with lower yield after controlling for county and year fixed effects, robustly across thirteen specifications. Not: temperature caused yield to decline.

## Champaign County

| Metric                              | Champaign | State panel |
| ----------------------------------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Mean yield, 2015-2025               | 64.3      | 58.7        |
| Technology trend, bu/acre/yr        | 0.660     | 0.627       |
| Moisture sensitivity, bu/acre per SD| 1.740     | 0.47 - 3.60 |
| Sensitivity rank                    | 53 / 91   | —           |
| **Simulated Δ under +1 °C, −10%**   | **−0.24** | −0.73       |

High-yielding, near-median sensitivity, and **less exposed than the state average** under every perturbation. Champaign has 44 observations, 1980 to 2023; it was suppressed out of the 2024 and 2025 county data. Its worst recorded year is 2003 at 13.99 bu/acre below trend, the year the climate model cannot explain.

## Data and verification

| Source | Access | Retrieved |

| USDA NASS Quick Stats | Query-tool CSV export, **no API key** | 2026-08-31 |
| NOAA NCEI nClimDiv | `ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/cirs/climdiv/`, `*cy-v1.0.0-20260806` | 2026-08-31 |

Both are United States federal works in the public domain.

| Verification | Result |
| --- | --- |
| County sums vs published state totals, 46 years, 3 measures | **Exact, 0.000% error** |
| `production_bu / acres_harvested == yield_bu_ac` | 4,459 of 4,459, max residual 0.25 |
| `acres_harvested <= acres_planted` | No violations |
| Duplicate county-year keys | 0 |
| Climate join completeness | 4,459 of 4,459, zero nulls |
| Independent cross-check vs external NASS query | 21 of 21 values match |

The first check matters more than it sounds. Internal consistency tests pass even on a file that has silently lost rows, and an earlier build of this panel had done exactly that. **Only reconciliation against an independently published aggregate catches it.**

## Four traps this pipeline handles

1. **NASS publishes its suppressed-county bucket once per Agricultural Statistics District, not once per state.** In 2019 there are nine, all with a blank county ANSI. The raw key is `county_ansi + ag_district_code + year`. Keying on county and year alone silently collapses up to nine rows per year.
2. **Read `county_ansi` as text.** Integer casting turns `001` into `1` and drops Adams County from every join.
3. **Join on FIPS, never on name.** NASS writes `DU PAGE`, `ST CLAIR`, `JO DAVIESS`; Census writes `DuPage`, `St. Clair`, `Jo Daviess`.
4. **Never sum county rows to a state total after 2018.** 2025 county sums give 6.30M planted acres against an actual 10.30M. Use `data/raw/nass_il_state_totals.csv`.

## Methodology in brief

**Growing season.** April-September, planting through maturity.
**Critical window.** July-August, R3-R6, pod set and seed fill. Chosen agronomically and fixed before modelling, then supported empirically by finding 3.

**Inclusion rule.** Counties with at least 42 of 46 years. 91 counties, 4,051 rows. Fixed before modelling, not tuned on results.

**Panel.** Standard errors clustered on county throughout. Seven specifications escalating to two-way county and year fixed effects.

**Robustness.** Thirteen specifications. The temperature effect is negative and significant at 5% in **all thirteen**, with magnitude stable between −0.52 and −0.70. Dropping 1988, 2003 and 2012 halves it to −0.334, which is expected for a nonlinear damage function and reported as such.

## Design lineage

This is a structural translation of a Brazil state-level IBGE + ERA5 study design:

| Brazil design | This pipeline |
| --- | --- |
| IBGE production, state × year, 1974-2023 | USDA NASS, county × year, 1980-2025 |
| 27 states | 102 counties, 91 in balanced panel |
| ERA5 reanalysis, gridded t2m + tp | NOAA NCEI nClimDiv, county monthly |
| State boundaries | Census county FIPS + NASS Ag Districts |
| State + year fixed effects | County + year fixed effects |
| State climate-sensitivity ranking | County climate-sensitivity ranking |
| `production_tonnes` | **`yield_anom`**, detrended yield |

**On the target variable.** Production confounds area expansion, which the source design itself lists as a confounder. This pipeline targets the county-detrended yield anomaly to isolate the climate signal. `production_tonnes` and `yield_kg_ha` are carried in the final dataset for international comparability.

**On the climate source.** nClimDiv plays the ERA5 role, with one structural difference stated plainly: NCEI performs the gridding and polygon aggregation upstream, so this pipeline executes no area-weighting step of its own. That removes a source of analyst error but also removes a documented methodological choice, and it fixes the temporal resolution at monthly.
